                            Our products are handmade in Los Angeles and they are currently in extremely high demand. Once production is complete, your product will ship. Please see notes on shipping below. <strong>Current shipping times are estimates.</strong> Many factors are currently causing delays:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>COVID-19:</strong> We've taken measures to ensure the safety of our employees, which could affect production time.</li>
                            <li><strong>FedEx delays:</strong> Due to high levels of demand, FedEx has not been able to scan all shipments when they pick them up from the warehouse. It's this scan that normally triggers an email to you communicating that your product has shipped.</li>
                            <li><strong>Material shortages:</strong> Some manufacturers are still not working at full capacity, making it more difficult to match the demand.</li>
                            <li><strong>Brentwood Home mattresses are handmade in Los Angeles, California.</strong> If the shipping address is in the same region, your delivery time will be greatly reduced.</li>
                            <li><strong>Note that smaller size mattresses usually ship faster.</strong></li>
                        </ul>
